<p><a class="product-link" href="http://blog.hannahsowd.com/2011/07/28/chemical-peels.aspx" target="_blank">The Jessner&#39;s Peel</a>&nbsp;is a medium depth chemical peel that combines lactic acid, salicylic acid and resorcinol for lightening hyper-pigmentation and melasma. This specific combination of acid was pioneered over 30 years ago by Dr. Max Jessner as a way to reduce the harsh side effects of stronger acids yet provide significant results.<br /><br />Approximately, 36-48 hours after the treatment, the skin begins flaking. The amount of flaking depends on the amount of dead skin build up: if you exfoliate regularly the flaking may be light, if not it may be more intense. The flaking lasts for 3-5 days and you are left with smoother, more even-toned skin. You may apply sunscreen and makeup after your treatment but the solution must remain on the skin for at least 5 hours.</p>
