<h3>TCA PEEL <span id="price">[45 minutes]</span> $225.00</h3>
<p>More aggressive than the Jessners Peel, the Trichloroacetic Acid Peel removes thin surface layers of aged and damaged skin. This is an excellent treatment for blemish-prone skin, pigmentation problems, sun damage or general skin laxity.</p>
<p>Approximately, 36-48 hours after the treatment, the skin begins flaking. The amount of flaking depends on the amount of dead skin build up: if you exfoliate regularly the flaking may be light, if not it may be more intense. The flaking lasts for 5-7 days and you are left with smoother, more even-toned skin. You may apply sunscreen and makeup after your treatment but the solution must remain on the skin for at least 5 hours.</p>
