<h3>SKIN REHAB <span id="price">[6 treatments + products]</span> $575.00</h3>

<p>A 12 week treatment series designed to get oily, acne prone skin on the road to recovery.</p>

<p>Skin Rehab begins with a detailed consultation to discuss your skin care goals. Your first treatment is a Cleansing Facial, which includes extractions and a vitamin mask to jump start the healing process. Two weeks later, you return for a Glycolic Acid Peel and more extractions (if necessary). Then the process begins again: you will have a session every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, alternating between the Cleansing Facial and the Glycolic Peel.</p>
